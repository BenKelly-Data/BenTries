- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben Kelly.
- 👀 I’m most interested in exploring music and conservation data, along learning about information policy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of Python to transfer some of my previous R knowledge for a more marketable skillset.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that seem interesting! I'd also love to get more familiar with machine learning techniques.
